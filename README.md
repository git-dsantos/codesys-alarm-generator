This program allows for the user to create Alarms from outside the codesys devolopment evironment.
The motivation for this project comes from wanting to have an uncluttered environment to introduce the alarms, especially since I am running Codesys on a VM, using outdated hardware.
It also presents a solution for interoperability with a coworker without him needing the whole codesys software installed.

WARNING: This project was close to entirely Vibecoded with little manual input.

Tested OS:
- Windows 11
- Arch Linux + Wine

If you just want to run the program and have no interest in the source code download only the dist folder and run the executable.
