This program allows for the user to create Alarms from outside the codesys devolopment evironment.
The motivation for this project comes from wanting to have an uncluttered environment to introduce the alarms, especially since I am running Codesys on a VM, using outdated hardware.

WARNING: This project was close to entirely Vibecoded with little manual input.

Tested OS:
- Windows 11
